# Mercator

A web application for browsing and analyzing public RNA-seq data

# Description

### Overview

This is a repository for the web application [Mercator](http://www.mercatorproject.com) Mercator is a web application for analysis and discovery of publicly available RNA-seq data. More information on is available at our [Documentation](https://sulab.github.io/mercator_shiny/)

### Motivation

Reproducibility is a major concern of contemporary science, but many of the archived results are difficult to access and even more difficult to fully utilize
Mercator's goal is to empower researchers who wish to take advantage of the massive repositories of expression results available through services such as SRA.

### Features

Currently, Mercator uses data from a major computational effort by [Recount2](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/) to standardize re-processing of expression sequencing datasets.
Mercator offers pre-computed clustering, differential expression, standardized metadata and marker gene analysis results for around 35,000 samples.

### Re-use and contributions statement

All our code and analysis results are open-source and free-to-use.
